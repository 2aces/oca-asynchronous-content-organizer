## TODO

### Roadmap

- better "loading content" placeholder/behavior
	- early loading if localStorage or maybe using Web Worker / Service Workder

		- https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/02/making-a-service-worker/

- Delay after trigger
- ajax delay between queue items
- security, sanitization and validation
	- php
	- js
- different triggers (domload, click, etc)
- manage which function is already being fetched, to avoid multiple clicks in the same button to load the same content over and over
- backend caching
- remove unnecessary variables and methods
- improve logic / pseudo refactor
	- find alternative to use global
	- improve error handling
		- backend
		- frontend (including timeout)
	- improve call back (maybe http://stackoverflow.com/a/4351575/3594287 )
- javascript localization
- improve documentation
- drop jquery / pseudo refactor
